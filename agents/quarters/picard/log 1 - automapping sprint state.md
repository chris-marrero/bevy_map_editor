## PRs Open

| PR | Author | Branch | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| #1 | Geordi | `sprint/automapping/geordi-engine` | Awaiting Data GO |
| #3 | Barclay | `sprint/automapping/barclay-integration` | Awaiting Data GO — merge this first |
| #2 | Wesley | `sprint/automapping/wesley-ui` | Awaiting PR #3 merge, then Wesley rebases, then Data reviews |

**Merge order constraint:** PR #3 must merge before PR #2 can be rebased or reviewed. Data enforces this.

## Blocked

- Worf automapping tests blocked on Data reviewing PRs #1/#3 and PR #3 merging.

## Handle at Next Session Start

- Check whether Data has reviewed any of PRs #1, #2, #3.
- If PR #3 has merged: confirm Wesley has rebased.
- If all PRs merged: unblock Worf and spawn him.
- Close retro_log.md automapping sprint entry when sprint is complete.

## Pending Administrative

- Riker proposals file (`agents/riker_claude_md_proposals.md`) contains 5 unapplied CLAUDE.md proposals. Riker to apply or defer. See Riker's PADD.
